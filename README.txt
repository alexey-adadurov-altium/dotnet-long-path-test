
1. Please only use Debug configuration.

2. Build and run LongPathTest.Runner -- it will run the executors for .NET 4.8 
   (with and without application manifest) and .NET Core 3.1 (with .NET Core no manifest is needed).

3. When using on a non-dev system, make sure to copy these files:

   LongPathTest.Runner\bin\Debug\LongPathTest.Runner.exe
   LongPathTest.Runner\bin\Debug\LongPathTest.Runner.exe.config
   LongPathTest.Runner\bin\Debug\executors\*.*

4. System requirements: .NET 4.8, .NET Core 3.1

Thank you!
